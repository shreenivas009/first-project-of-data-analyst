This is my first demo project, I'll make a better project than a demo because I'm improving my skills in data analysis.

I'm using a Tableau tool for data visualization.

Project steps:
  1. Inject dataset into Excel file
  2. Analysis of data in Excel
  3. Cleaning data like duplicate and NALL values.
  4. Inject clean data into the Tableau tool (ETL)
  5. Set Data types
  6. Building a chart as needed for product analysis
  7. created dashboard and adding a all chart into dashboard
